GitHub's community benefits are substantial, but they also carry potential risks. 
The fact that anyone can propose bug fixes publicly comes with certain responsibilities. 
The most important is the responsible disclosure of information that could lead to security

security issues look for a SECURITY.md file in the root of a repository in order to responsibly disclose their concerns. 
Providing guidance in this file ultimately speeds up the resolution of these critical issues.
